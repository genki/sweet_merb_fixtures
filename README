sweet_merb_fixtures
===================

A plugin for the Merb framework and DataMapper that provides the system to create records from YAML files.

The Location of YAML files:
  You can specify the directory for fixture YAML files by
    
    Merb::Plugins.config[:sweet_merb_fixtures][:fixture_dir] = path / to / your_dir
 
  If you don't specify any direcotry,  Merb.dir_for(:lib) / fixtures  is used.

How to use:
  Send this method in merb irb console,

    merb -i
    >> Merb::Fixtures.load_fixture("filename without extension", "file2", "file3")
  
  Or

    merb -i
    >> MF.load_fixture(:file1, :file2)
  
  is also possible.

  When using rspec, write above code in before block, or
  if you include Merb::Fixture module as helper methods,

    Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
      config.include(Merb::Fixtures)
    end

  load_fixtures("key") and fixtures[:name] methods will be available.

Another Settings:
  By default DataMapper.auto_migrate! is called before storing reocrds. if you don't want this

    Merb::Plugins.config[:sweet_merb_fixtures][:auto_migrate] = false

  Or you can override Merb::Fixture.prepare_database.

  These method are chainable:

    Merb::Fixtures::Hash#code_to_create_record
    Merb::Fixtures::Hash#code_to_create_child_record
    Merb::Fixtures::Hash#code_to_report
    Merb::Fixtures::Hash#code_to_report_errors

Features:
  1. you can write parameters of multiple storage in a file.
    cats:
      -
        name: Tama
      -
        name: Tora
    dogs:
      -
        name: Pochi
      -
        name: Hachi

    parents:
      -
        name: Tama
        children:
          -
            name: Tora
      
  3. you can specify the name of records.

    cats:
      -
        # pass string as id
        id: white 
        name: Tama

  4. you can specify the common value of records.

    cats:
      # The way could be better.
      :"{color: white}"
        -
          name: Tama
        -
          name: Shiro
 
  5. you can write erb code in yaml file
    cats:
      -
        name: <%= "a" * 5 %>


  More details are in spec doc, actually possible ways are gradually increasing,
  it's better to see YAML files under spec/fixture/lib/fixtures/*.yml.
